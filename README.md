# MDN Learn: HTML & CSS Challenges

Testing my Web Development skills facing the challenges suggested by
[MDN Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

## Where are the JavaScript challenges

Nowadays, there are so many `client-side` websites done with `JavaScript`.
Furthermore, with `Node.js` you can create `full-stack` or `server-side` apps
with this language. As I wanted to learn and improve my skills in `JavaScript` I
decide to create two specific repositories to do so:

- [JavaScript Challenges](https://github.com/pabcrudel/javascript-challenges)
- [JS Refactoring & Unit
  Testing](https://github.com/pabcrudel/js-refactoring-and-unit-testing)

## How to Merge 2 Git Repositories and preserve history

When I start doing the MDN Learn challenges, I've made a repository for CSS
challenges and another one for HTML. However, when I was doing the task of
[Typesetting a community school homepage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Typesetting_a_homepage)
I thought that having 2 separated repositories make no sense so I merge them.

### How to do it step-by-step

#### 1. Clone repositories to merge

First of all you must clone the repositories that you want to merge. To make
this process easier I specify a shorter name to each repository: html and css.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git html
```

In my case, I clone these repositories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pabcrudel/mdn-learn-html-introduction.git html
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pabcrudel/mdn-learn-css-challenges.git css
```

#### 2. Create a new repository

Create a new folder and start a new repository there.

```bash
mkdir merged-challenges
cd merged-challenges
git init
```

#### 3. Add the existing repositories as a remotes

```bash
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-path>
```

I cloned my repositories in the same parent folder so I use a simple
relative path.

```bash
git remote add html ../html
git remote add css ../css
```

#### 4. Merge the repositories

This step is a little bit tricky. If there were conflicts, you must solve it
before merging. In order to avoid problems, I prefer not to auto-commit changes.

```bash
git fetch <remote-name>
git merge <remote-name>/<branch-name> --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories
```

I chose to start with HTML. As it was the first one, there was no conflicts.
However, when I do so with CSS I had to resolve them because I had 2
`README.md` or `LICENSE.md`.

```bash
git fetch html
git merge html/main --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories
git commit -m "Merging from html/main"
```

```bash
git fetch css
git merge css/main --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories

# [... solve conflicts ...]

git commit -m "Merging from html/css"
```

#### 5. Testing that the history has been preserved

To do so you must inspect the logs.

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

That's what I get from that command. As you can see, all commits from each
repository are there so I can go back in history:

#### 6. Remove remotes

Once successfully merged, you can remove the remotes or leave them there. In my
case, I prefer to remove them because I want to upload it to GitHub.

If you remove the remotes and inspect the logs again, all tags that references
the legacy repositories will disappear.

```bash
git remote remove <remote-name>
```

Don't forget to remove both remotes.

```bash
git remote remove html
git remote remove css
```

Then you can upload to GitHub this merged repository.
